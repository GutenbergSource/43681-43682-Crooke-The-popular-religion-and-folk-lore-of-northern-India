<HTML><BODY>A typical nineteenth-century scientific study of folklore, with numerous footnotes, and the occasional citation from a Greek and Latin classic. 

<p>Please carefully check of the circumflexes (indicating long vowels) in the Indian words used. Please put every footnote on its own line, even if they are in one line on the page image.

<p>Have fun!
